- F#: F# (pronounced F sharp) is a functional-first, general purpose, strongly typed, multi-paradigm programming language that encompasses functional, imperative, and object-oriented programming methods. 

G: 
- Go: Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.

H:
- Haskell: Haskell (/ˈhæskəl/) is a general-purpose, statically typed, purely functional programming language with type inference and lazy evaluation.
- Html: The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.


J:
- Java: Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.
- Javascript: JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/), often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
- Julia: Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language.

K:
- Kotlin: Kotlin (/ˈkɒtlɪn/) is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference.

L:
- Lua (/ˈluːə/ LOO-ə; from Portuguese: lua [ˈlu.(w)ɐ] meaning moon) is a lightweight, high-level, multi-paradigm programming language designed primarily for embedded use in applications.
- Lisp: Lisp (historically LISP) is a family of programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation.

O:
- Objective-c: Objective-C is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language that adds Smalltalk-style messaging to the C programming language.

P:
- Pascal: Pascal is an imperative and procedural programming language, designed by Niklaus Wirth as a small, efficient language intended to encourage good programming practices using structured programming and data structuring.
- Perl: Perl is a family of two high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages.
- Powershell: PowerShell or Microsoft PowerShell (formerly Windows PowerShell) is a task automation and configuration management program from Microsoft, consisting of a command-line shell and the associated scripting language.
- Purescript: PureScript is a strongly-typed, purely-functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript.
- Python: Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language.

R:
- R: R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Core Team and the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.
- Raku: Raku is a member of the Perl family of programming languages.
- Ruby: Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language which supports multiple programming paradigms.
- Rust: Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency.

S:
- Scala: Scala (/ˈskɑːlɑː/ SKAH-lah) is a strong statically typed general-purpose programming language which supports both object-oriented programming and functional programming.
- Self: Self is an object-oriented programming language based on the concept of prototypes. 
- Swift: Swift is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc.
